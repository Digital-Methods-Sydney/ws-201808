## Program

### 10:30 - 12:30 An introduction to [TriSMA](https://trisma.org/) and its applications for social research by [Prof. Axel Bruns](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/bruns/)

>> Social media are increasingly embedded in the Australian media ecology, and provide rich insights into a range of issues and debates of high importance to our society. TrISMA provides researchers with real-time, large-scale access to this stream of public communication, by establishing a subscription to major social media data sources. The TrISMA project establishes state-of-the-art technical and organisational infrastructure for the tracking of public communication by Australian users of social media, at large scale, in real time, and for the long term, addressing a significant gap in national research infrastructure. Systematic analyses of how public communication takes place via social media provide rich insights into a range of issues and debates of high importance to our society.
